Performed end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib). Merged multiple datasets, handled missing values, and conducted data cleaning. Created visualizations including histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, pairplots, and heatmaps to uncover trends and relationships between features (e.g., survival vs age, class, gender). Summarized insights and correlations to understand factors affecting survival.
